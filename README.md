## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS (SCSS)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It has been a while since my previous project therefore, this project allowed me to brush up on my JS. Also, I enjoyed recreating the design to match the design provided. @It was wuite difficult finding the right `background-color` for the body's background so I changed some properties to find the most similar color. Overall, this was a fun and enjoyable project that didn't take me too long to complete.

### Continued development

For future developments, I want to continue making responsive web layouts and feel more confident with it. Also, I want to implement more JS into my work such as a nav-bar.
